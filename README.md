# EcoWise

## About
-EcoWise is a mobile-first sustainability web platform designed to help consumers make climate-conscious choices in their everyday shopping. By combining real-time product data, transparent environmental scoring, and community-driven insights, the app transforms routine purchases into opportunities for impact. Users can scan barcodes or search for products to instantly view sustainability scores based on emissions, packaging, sourcing, and ethical practices using green rates. The platform then suggests eco-friendly alternatives and tracks personal metrics like CO₂ saved and plastic avoided, offering a tangible sense of progress. EcoWise also includes a community section where users share tips, rate products, and engage in discussions—building trust and collective awareness around sustainable living.
