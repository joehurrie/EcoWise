To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

1.  Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file.
2.  Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](httpss://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Deploying to Vercel

When deploying to Vercel, you will need to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Vercel project settings.
